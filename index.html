      <h1 class="page-title">Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Bruce Lee, and I’m currently a third-year English
        major at Cal Poly, where I’ve eagerly immersed myself in the world of
        literature, critical thinking, and creative expression. Alongside my
        major, I’m pursuing minors in French and Political Science (focusing on
        global politics), driven by my fascination with cross-cultural
        communication and international relations. I’ve also taken the exciting
        step of working toward a Technical and Professional Communication
        certificate through Cal Poly’s TPC program, where I’m learning to craft
        clear, compelling content for a variety of real-world contexts. Together,
        these fields challenge me to approach the written word from multiple
        perspectives—combining creativity, analytical insight, and practical
        communication skills.
      </p>

        Away from my studies, you can often find me hitting the gym to stay
        active, rallying on the badminton court, or occasionally losing myself in
        the vibrant pages of a comic book. I was born in China and moved to the
        U.S. when I was 13, which gave me the privilege of becoming bilingual in
        Mandarin and English. This cultural journey has deeply influenced my love
        of languages, as well as my eagerness to connect with people from all
        walks of life. Through my academic pursuits and personal passions, I
        aspire to forge meaningful bridges—whether they be linguistic, cultural,
        or intellectual—and I’m excited to see where this adventure takes me next.
        Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my site!

        Also, I created this website completely by coding with html and css. There is
        actually a lot more for me to learn about coding but I am very excited to explore
        anything new!
